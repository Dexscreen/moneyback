                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-red-800 mb-2">‚ö†Ô∏è Immediate Action Required</h3>
                    <p class="text-red-700">If you've recently downloaded a Coinbase wallet app, verify its authenticity immediately. Fake apps are stealing cryptocurrency within hours of installation.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8">
                    A sophisticated wave of fake Coinbase wallet applications has infiltrated major app stores, stealing millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from unsuspecting users. These fraudulent apps are nearly identical to the legitimate Coinbase Wallet, making them extremely difficult to detect without careful verification.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Scale of the Problem</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    Security researchers have identified over 40 fake Coinbase wallet apps across iOS and Android platforms in the past month alone. These malicious applications have collectively stolen an estimated $12 million in cryptocurrency, with individual victims losing anywhere from $500 to $250,000.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    The fake apps are particularly dangerous because they function normally at first, allowing users to create wallets and even make small transactions. This builds trust before the apps steal larger deposits or drain existing wallets when users import their seed phrases.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">How the Fake Apps Work</h2>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Stage 1: Infiltration</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Scammers create apps with names like "Coinbase Wallet Pro," "Coinbase Wallet - Crypto," or "Coinbase: Buy Bitcoin & Crypto." They use official Coinbase logos, colors, and interface designs to appear legitimate. Some even include fake positive reviews and high download counts.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Stage 2: Trust Building</h3>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    The fake apps allow normal wallet creation and small transactions initially. Users can send and receive small amounts of cryptocurrency, which builds confidence in the app's legitimacy. This phase can last days or weeks.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Stage 3: The Theft</h3>
                <p class="mb-6">
                    Once users deposit larger amounts or import existing wallets using seed phrases, the apps steal the cryptocurrency. The theft often happens during "maintenance" periods or when users attempt larger transactions.
                </p>

                <div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-6 mb-8">
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-blue-800 mb-2">Real Victim Story</h3>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 mb-3">
                        "I downloaded what I thought was the official Coinbase Wallet app from the Google Play Store. It looked identical to the real one and even had thousands of positive reviews. I used it for two weeks with small amounts before importing my existing wallet with $45,000 in Bitcoin. Within 24 hours, everything was gone." - Jennifer K., California
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-blue-700 text-sm">
                        Jennifer's case is typical - the fake app worked perfectly for small transactions before stealing her life savings when she imported her main wallet.

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Broader Fake Wallet Problem</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">
                    Fake Coinbase wallets are part of a larger trend of fraudulent cryptocurrency applications. Scammers are also creating fake versions of MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Exodus, and other popular crypto wallets. The same verification principles apply to all cryptocurrency applications.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-6">
                    App stores are struggling to keep up with the volume of fake apps being submitted. While they remove fraudulent applications when reported, new ones appear daily. Users must remain vigilant and verify every crypto app before use.
